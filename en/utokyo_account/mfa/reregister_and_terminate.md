title: Reregistering Verification Method and Terminating the Use of Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts
---

This page describes the following procedures regarding[UTokyo Account Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](.): “Reregistering Verification Method” for MFA, and “Terminating MFA use”. Since the purpose of the two procedures are different, please confirm which of the following is appropriate for you and follow the instructions.

- **Reregister Verification Method**：In case you lost access to all verification methods and are unable to sign in to the UTokyo Account, we can take measures to allow you to retry the registration process for MFA all over again and keep using MFA.
    - Check if any of your verification methods can be used beforehand as described below. Please follow the procedure only if all verification methods were not available.
- **Terminate** MFA Use： If you want to disable MFA and reverse your UTokyo Account settings to allow signing in with only a password, please follow this procedure. We strongly recommend that you use MFA for security reasons, but we can take measures to terminate MFA use for unavoidable circumstances. Be aware that after terminating MFA, you can not use[UTokyo VPN](/utokyo_vpn/)and[UTokyo Slack](/slack/), which requires MFA.

The “Reregistering Verification Method” procedure was renamed from “Resetting” procedure in September 2022.

## The outline of each procedure

### Reregister the Verification Method
{:#reregister}

#### Check If Any Other Verification Methods Are Available

When one of your verification method is unavailable due to malfunction, phone model change, etc., and alternative methods are still available, you can use one of them for verification.

Click the “Having trouble? Sign in another way” or “Use a different verification option” link in the verification screen that appears (after entering your password).

A list of verification methods that you set up (including the default sign-in method) will be displayed.

- If any of the verification methods in the list are available for use, you can use the method to sign in to your UTokyo Account.
- If none of the methods in the list are available, you need to reregister your verification method for MFA. Please move on to the procedures below.

#### Reregister the Verification Method

If none of the verification methods registered are available, reregister your verification method by the following procedure.

1. Please apply for reregistration by following the procedures in“[ “Application”](#application-method)”
1. The MFA verification method will be initialized for reregistration procedures. An Email will be sent for the notification after a while.
1. After you received the Email, follow the instructions in“[Step 1: Set Up the First Verification Method](initial#first)” and “[Step 2: Add Alternative Verification Methods] in the“[Initial Setup Procedure of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for UTokyo Accounts](initial)”page to set up new verification methods.
1. You can now sign in to your UTokyo Account with the registered verification method.

During this procedure, **you are strongly recommended to register multiple verification methods** to avoid being locked out from your UTokyo Account because the registered verification method becomes unavailable again.

### Terminate MFA Use
{:#terminate}

We recommend that you use MFA for security reasons, but, for unavoidable circumstances, we can take measures to terminate MFA use and reverse your UTokyo Account settings to allow signing in with only a password. Please follow the instructions below.

1. Please apply for termination by following the procedures in “[Application](#application-method)”.
1. The MFA for your account will be terminated. An Email will be sent for the notification after a while.
1. You can now sign in to your UTokyo Account only with a password. It will take approximately 40 minutes maximum for the termination to be reflected in the system, so please wait for a while.

After terminating MFA use, [UTokyo VPN](/utokyo_vpn/)and[UTokyo Slack](/slack/), which require MFA, will be unavailable.
