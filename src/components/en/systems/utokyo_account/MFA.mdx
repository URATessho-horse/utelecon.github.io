Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity using at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, or other methods when signing into their accounts. At UTokyo, we are requiring the enabling of MFA for your UTokyo Account to enhance security throughout the university. To enable MFA, please follow the setup procedures in the "[Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts
](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial)" page.
Once you enable MFA, you will be able to use [UTokyo Wi-Fi](/en/utokyo_wifi/), [UTokyo VPN](/en/utokyo_vpn/), and [UTokyo Slack](/en/slack/).
