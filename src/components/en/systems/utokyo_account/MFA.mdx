- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity using at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, or other methods when signing into their accounts. MFA setup is not mandatory at this time, but it is hignly recommended from a better security aspect for your UTokyo Account.

1. Please follow the setup procedures in the "[Using Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/)" page.
