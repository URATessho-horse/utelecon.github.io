    ### Step 1: Check the devices to be used

      Laptops, smartphones, and tablets can generally connect to UTokyo Wi-Fi. However, other types of electronic devices and older devices may not be able to connect. For example, devices that do not support WPA2-Enterprise cannot be connected. Please check for updates to the OS and drivers of your devices and update them appropriately before connecting to UTokyo Wi-Fi.

    ### Step 2: Apply for a UTokyo Wi-Fi Account

      UTokyo Wi-Fi is available to UTokyo Account holders, but UTokyo Wi-Fi Account is required for each academic year in addition to your UTokyo Account. In this “Step 2”, we will explain the procedure for applying for a dedicated UTokyo Wi-Fi account.

      You can apply for your own account using the “UTokyo Wi-Fi Account Menu”. The user ID and password for your account can be viewed on the “UTokyo Wi-Fi Account Menu” screen only immediately after submitting application, and you will also be notified by email. Please note that you can use your issued UTokyo Wi-Fi account to connect to UTokyo Wi-Fi on multiple devices.
