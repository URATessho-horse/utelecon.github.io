## What is ITC-LMS

[ITC-LMS](https://itc-lms.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) is a learning management system of the University of Tokyo. Features of ITC-LMS include distribution of lecture materials, submission of assignments, online examinations, and notification from faculty members to students.

For using ITC-LMS, [UTokyo Account](/utokyo_account/) is required. If you have not yet started using UTokyo Account, please read "[Getting Ready for ICT Systems at UTokyo](/en/oc/) (for New Students)" or "[Getting Ready for ICT Systems at the UTokyo](/en/faculty_members/) (for Faculty Members)" first.

## (For instructors) Advantages of using ITC-LMS

- ITC-LMS has functions for communicating and sharing information with students, which becomes increasingly important when conducting online classes where students do not meet face-to-face in the classroom.
- ITC-LMS is linked with the University of Tokyo account (UTokyo Account) and the academic affairs system (UTAS) for course registration. It makes it easy to pass information **"only to students at the University of Tokyo" or "only to those enrolled in that course"**. It is much safer than disseminating information on a public page.
- It is thought that most current students who took classes in their first or second year at the University of Tokyo have used the service, so the penetration rate among students is high.
