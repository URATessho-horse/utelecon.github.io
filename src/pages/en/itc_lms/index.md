## (For instructors) Advantages of using ITC-LMS

Services of ITC-LMS are similar to other ICT class support tools. Noteworthy is that the system is linked to UTokyo Account and the Academic Affair System (UTAS) for course registration. **This makes it very easy to pass information only to "students of UTokyo" or only to "students enrolled in the course"**. It is presumed that almost every first or second year undergraduates have used this system. In other words, **the penetration rate of ITC-LMS is high among students**. When distributing lecture materials and collecting/returning assignments, using ITC-LMS is highly recommended.
