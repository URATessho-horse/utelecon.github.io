## Participant registration by the instructor
To enroll a teacher or TA who is co-teaching a course (not registered in UTAS), you must register the course participants. You may also enroll students not enrolled to participate in the course.

1. On the course screen, select the three line icon at the top left to bring out the menu options.

* When searching for faculty members, search by the "Common ID" instead of "Student ID number".
* You can also use batch registration using Excel files.
* When searching for a faculty member, a "User ID" with the same name but a number other than 10 digits may come up. This is left to refer to the contents of the old ITC-LMS.  Instructors can no longer login to the old UTAS, so if you want the instructor to participate in the course, register the  10 digit number for the user ID.
* Do not use the search function for students or faculty members unless you really need it.
