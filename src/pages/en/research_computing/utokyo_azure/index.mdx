## About UTokyo Azure

In August 2023, the University of Tokyo and Microsoft entered into a basic agreement regarding future collaboration [(News release)](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/articles/z1701_00013.html), and based on this agreement, Microsoft will provide the University of Tokyo with credits for using Microsoft's cloud service Azure. A donation (gift) was made. 

UTokyo Azure is the name of the service that allows the University of Tokyo members to widely use Microsoft Azure cloud services using gift credits. For Microsoft Azure

- Virtual machine service for running Linux and Windows and more environments
- A service that operates multiple Linux servers as a cluster (high-performance computing environment)

In addition,

- Browser-based computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook
- Services that use Openai AI systems via a browser, and services that use it in API

Also provided. In addition, as a type of computer, a wide variety of CPUs, GPUs can be selected, and can be used in various uses and fields.

## Policy / Goal

Operation is performed by the Information Technology Center, the Information System Department, and the Information System Headquarters. The basic policies and goals for providing are as follows.

- By lowering the threshold for starting to use the service and shortening the time lag, we hope that many people, including first-time users, will use it, and we will eliminate the cost and time required to procure computers that would otherwise be necessary, and our university's services. Contributing to the acceleration of research.
- Select the services that can be used on the operation side, and make the services available in Azure widely available without narrowly limiting them.
  - In principle, all services provided by Microsoft Azure will be available as is (the operations department will not intervene in individual users' environments).
  - However, services that are deemed difficult to provide due to contractual or operational reasons may not be provided.
  - Services that can easily become expensive or large-capacity may be prohibited by default.
  - There is a plan for operators to prepare a standard environment of a certain scale to support users who want to use standard use cases without the hassle of setting up an environment.
- Since gift credits are limited, the amount of gift credits consumed across the university will be controlled and can be used free of charge within that range. If usage exceeds the set target amount, users may be charged according to the excess amount. For details, please refer to the terms of use and fee regulations.

## Try using it
- You can immediately log in to the [Azure Portal] (https://portal.azure.com/)  using your UTokyo Account. You can check in advance what services are available to you without consuming credits.
