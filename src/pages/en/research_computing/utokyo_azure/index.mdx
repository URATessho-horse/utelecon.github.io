UTokyo Azure is a service that allows Microsoft Azure cloud services by this donation to be widely used by members of the University of Tokyo. For Microsoft Azure

- Virtual machine service for running Linux and Windows and more environments
- A service that operates multiple Linux servers as a cluster (high-performance computing environment)

In addition,

- Browser-based computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook
- Services that use Openai AI systems via a browser, and services that use it in API

Also provided. In addition, as a type of calculator, a wide variety of CPUs, GPUs can be selected, and can be used in various uses and fields.

## Policy / Goal

Operation is performed by the Information Technology Center, the Information System Department, and the Information System Headquarters. The basic policies and goals for providing are as follows.

- The lower threshold until the start of use, shorten the time lag, ask many people to use it, including the first person, and eliminate the cost and time of the calculation machine that will be required without this service, and this school. Contribute to the acceleration of research
- All select services available on the operation side and use Azure -available services widely without narrow.
  - In principle, the operation side does not enter the environment of individual users, so that the environment of normal Microsoft Azure can be used as it is.
  - However, services that are difficult to provide in operation may not be provided.
  - Proof the standard environment of the operational side and support users who want to use standard use cases without having to do so in the environment.
