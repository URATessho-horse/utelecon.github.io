## About UTokyo Azure

In August 2023, The University of Tokyo and Microsoft corporation signed a basic agreement on collaboration [News Release(japanese)] (https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/ja/articles/z1701_00012.html). based on this agreement, Microsoft will be donated to the University of Tokyo in the form of credit for Microsoft Azure.

UTokyo Azure is a service that allows Microsoft Azure cloud services by this donation to be widely used by members of the University of Tokyo. For Microsoft Azure

- Virtual machine service for running Linux and Windows and more environments
- A service that operates multiple Linux servers as a cluster (high-performance computing environment)

In addition,

- Browser-based computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook
- Services that use Openai AI systems via a browser, and services that use it in API

Also provided. In addition, as a type of calculator, a wide variety of CPUs, GPUs can be selected, and can be used in various uses and fields.

## Policy / Goal

Operation is performed by the Information Technology Center, the Information System Department, and the Information System Headquarters. The basic policies and goals for providing are as follows.

- It is easy to start using it and takes less time, including the first person, and eliminate the cost and time of the calculation machine that will be required without this service, and this school. Contribute to the acceleration of research
- We will make the services available on Azure widely available, without limiting the services that can be used by us as a UTokyo Azure operators.
  - In principle, operations will not intervene in individual users' environments, and users will be able to use the normal Microsoft Azure environment as is.
  - However, services that are deemed difficult to provide from an operational standpoint may not be provided.
  - In addition, the operator will prepare a standard usage environment in advance to support users who want to use standard use cases without the hassle of setting up the environment.
- The credits are to be provided for a period of five years and are limited, so the total amount of usage across the university will be controlled and provided within that range. If the total amount is exceeded each year, users will be charged according to the amount of usage.

## Try using it
- You can immediately log in to the [Azure Portal] (https://portal.azure.com/)  using your UTokyo Account. You can check in advance what services are available to you without consuming credits.
- To actually start using UTokyo Azure, you will need to open a "subscription" (similar to a wallet) for this service that is linked to your account. To do this, first apply on the University of Tokyo Azure Cloud Usage Application Page (link when published).
