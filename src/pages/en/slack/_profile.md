When using UTokyo Slack, we recommend that you set up your profile appropriately. In particular, the "Display Name" field in your profile is the information that is usually<!--見る側が環境設定で変えていない限り--> displayed as your name in messages, etc. However, it is initially set as the 10-digit Common ID due to system specifications. Therefore, it is recommended that you set a name that others can recognize.

The procedure for changing your profile is as follows (if you are using a PC).

1. Press the “person” symbol in the upper right corner of the workspace screen.
1. Select "Profile" from the menu that appears.
1. Click on the "Edit" button to the right of your name.
1. The edit screen will open, allowing you to make changes to each item in your profile. When finished, press the "Save Changes" button in the lower right corner.

Please note that due to the specifications of the Enterprise Grid plan, UTokyo Slack **profiles are common to the entire UTokyo Slack and cannot be set up differently for each workspace**.
