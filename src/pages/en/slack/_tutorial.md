For information on how to use Slack within a workspace, you may find Slack's official help "[Getting started for new Slack users](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users)", "[How to use Slack: your quick start guide](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide)" and [tutorials](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/categories/360000049063) helpful. Also, it may be a good idea to ask existing members on its use, as some workspace members may have their own rules for using Slack.
