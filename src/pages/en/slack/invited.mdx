This page describes the procedure for joining UTokyo Slack by receiving an invitation from a specific workspace. The procedures differ depending on whether you are already using UTokyo Slack or have just started using UTokyo Slack. 

## If you are already using UTokyo Slack

If you are already using UTokyo Slack, you will receive a direct message from the Slackbot in the UTokyo Slack workspace you are currently in. This message contains a link to the workspace, which will take you to the workspace you have been invited to.
