<Emergency />


* The Technical Support Desk aims to respond to inquiries regarding online classes and web conferences.
* To expand our services, support is co-operated by student staff ("Common Supporters") and faculty members.
* We offer assistance through chats, Zoom, and email forms. Please contact us through the channel that best suits you. 
* See also [FAQ page](/en/faq/) for frequently asked questions and answers.


## Important Notes on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information 

* To ensure prompt response, **the support desk is generally staffed by students, as well as faculty staff. Please be aware of that fact when you make inquiries.** Student staff have signed confidentiality agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty members.
* If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, **please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examination. If you wish to contact the Technical Support Desk regarding examinations**, please contact us only through the email form. 
* Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying to and performing tasks related to the inquiry. Information may be shared internally to improve future support service. Information may also be disclosed to the public in individually unidentifiable form for the purpose of introducing UTokyo’s support initiatives through case studies and statistical information, etc. Information will not be used for any other purposes except for exceptions specified by laws and regulations.

## Support via Chat
{:#chat}

Chat support is available for simple inquiries. A chatbot (an automated response robot) or a human operator (student staff called “Common Supporter”) will respond to your inquiries.

* Please note that it may take some time for operators to respond, depending on the volume of inquiries. In such cases, please use the email form or try again later. 
* We use MEDiA LiNK. Co., Ltd.'s MediaTalk chat service. The connection may sometimes become unstable. If the connection does not improve after a certain period of time, please contact us through Zoom or the email form.

## Support via Zoom
{:#zoom}
Support is available via voice, chat, and screen sharing in a Zoom conference room. A student operator (also called “Common Supporter”) will answer questions and offer consultation.
When you access the Zoom meeting room, you will first be taken to a waiting room. Please wait there for your turn.
* Please note that it may take some time to enter a meeting room, depending on the volume of inquiries. In such cases, please use the email form or try again later. 
* We do not record voices or videos of the Zoom meeting. Users are also requested not to record any voices or videos of the meeting.
* To access meeting room information, you must sign in with your UTokyo Account.

## Support via Email Form
{:#email-form}

Email form support is available for difficult/complicated inquiries. A student operator (also called “Common Supporter”) will respond to your inquiry through email. Faculty members will take over if the issue cannot be resolved by student staff.

After submitting the form, a confirmation email and responses to your inquiry will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Therefore, if you enter your email address incorrectly, you will not receive both the confirmation email and the response to your inquiry. **Please be very careful when entering your email address.** Also, **if you do not receive a confirmation email, please submit your inquiry again through the form.**

<summary>If the inquiry includes sensitive information</summary>

For inquiries containing sensitive content that could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff, please submit through the form below. These inquiries will be addressed exclusively by faculty and staff. Before submitting, please review the following precautions.
<ul>
  <li>Due to the special nature of handling inquiries through this form, at the end of the form, we will ask for **the sections you deem sensitive and the reasons why.** The responsible faculty or staff member will review this content, and if it is determined not to be sensitive, we may inquire via reply if it is acceptable to transfer the handling of the response to student staff.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The sensitive content included in an inquiry primarily concerns **matters that may involve a conflict of interest if handled by student staff, particularly if the student staff member in question is directly involved and may not be able to appropriately address the inquiry as a result.** An example of such sensitive content would be information regarding a student's grades.</li>
    <li>On the other hand, the following types of information are not considered sensitive because student staff, having exchanged the necessary documents with and working under the management and supervision of faculty or staff members, handle these matters:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Internal information of laboratories or departments</li>
      <li>Information on individual accounts, such as current settings or access history</li>
      <li>Troubles related to signing into or connecting to systems, or issues with system settings</li>
    </ul>
    <li>For inquiries that do not contain sensitive content, please use the regular inquiry email form mentioned above.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Please be aware that inquiries submitted through this form are handled by a limited number of personnel compared to regular inquiries, and as a result, **it generally takes a few days to receive a response.**</li>
</ul>
