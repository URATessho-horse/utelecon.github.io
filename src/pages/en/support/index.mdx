<Emergency />


* The Technical Support Desk aims to respond to inquiries regarding online classes and web conferences.
* To expand our services, support is co-operated by student staff ("Common Supporters") and faculty members.
* We offer assistance through chats, Zoom, and email forms. Please contact us through the channel that best suits you. 
* See also [FAQ page](/en/faq/) for frequently asked questions and answers.


## Important Notes on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information 

* To ensure prompt response, **the support desk is generally staffed by students, as well as faculty staff. Please be aware of that fact when you make inquiries.** Student staff have signed confidentiality agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty and staff members, so there is no problem with general account information.
* If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, **please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examination. If you wish to contact the Technical Support Desk regarding examinations**, please contact us only through the email form. 
* Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying to and performing tasks related to the inquiry. Information may be shared internally to improve future support service. Information may also be disclosed to the public in individually unidentifiable form for the purpose of introducing UTokyo’s support initiatives through case studies and statistical information, etc. Information will not be used for any other purposes except for exceptions specified by laws and regulations.

## Support via Chat
{:#chat}

Chat support is available for simple inquiries. A chatbot (an automated response robot) or a human operator (student staff called “Common Supporter”) will respond to your inquiries.

* Please note that it may take some time for operators to respond, depending on the volume of inquiries. In such cases, please use the email form or try again later. 
* We use MEDiA LiNK. Co., Ltd.'s MediaTalk chat service. The connection may sometimes become unstable. If the connection does not improve after a certain period of time, please contact us through Zoom or the email form.

## Support via Zoom
{:#zoom}
Support is available via voice, chat, and screen sharing in a Zoom conference room. A student operator (also called “Common Supporter”) will answer questions and offer consultation.
When you access the Zoom meeting room, you will first be taken to a waiting room. Please wait there for your turn.
* Please note that it may take some time to enter a meeting room, depending on the volume of inquiries. In such cases, please use the email form or try again later. 
* We do not record voices or videos of the Zoom meeting. Users are also requested not to record any voices or videos of the meeting.
* To access meeting room information, you must sign in with your UTokyo Account.

## Support via Email Form
{:#email-form}

Email form support is available for difficult/complicated inquiries. A student operator (also called “Common Supporter”) will respond to your inquiry through email. Faculty members will take over if the issue cannot be resolved by student staff.

After submitting the form, a confirmation email and responses to your inquiry will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Therefore, if you enter your email address incorrectly, you will not receive both the confirmation email and the response to your inquiry. **Please be very careful when entering your email address**. Also, **if you do not receive a confirmation email, please submit your inquiry again through the form**.

<summary>For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff</summary>
For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff, special handling will be conducted via a dedicated form as described below.

- Information is considered to be sensitive if **there is a possibility that a member of student staff is a relevant party to the inquiry and this could cause a problematic situation**. An example of such sensitive content would be information regarding a student's grades.
    - Unless this condition is met, contents such as personal accounts and contact information, information related to operations performed in the system, and internal information of departments and laboratories are NOT considered to be sensitive. Since student staff have signed necessary agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty and staff members, there is no problem with the handling of these kinds of information.
- Inquiries submitted through the dedicated form will be addressed solely by faculty and staff members, unlike regular inquiries. However, we will ask for the sections you deem sensitive and the reasons why in this form, and if the inquiry seems not to be considered sensitive, we may ask you to allow handling the inquiry by student staff.
- The number of faculty and staff members who respond is limited. Therefore, it takes longer time to respond than regular inquiries, at least a few days.

If your inquiry does not contain sensitive information, please use the regular inquiry form above instead of this dedicated form.
