If the screen for entering { userIdField } and password does not appear in Step 2 and it fails to connect to the Wi-Fi, you need to delete the existing setting and register a new one. This is necessary because once you reissue your account, your previous account will become invalid, but your devices may still store it. Before using the new account, your devices must “forget” the previous one. There’s no need to worry that you will never be able to connect to UTokyo Wi-Fi again by “deleting” the account.
