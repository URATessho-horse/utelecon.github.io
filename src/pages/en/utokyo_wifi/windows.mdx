#### Supplement
{:#create-profile-notes}
* Enter the user ID and password of the UTokyo account into the field of “User name” and “Password”. Note that they are not the Common ID and password of UTokyo Account. You can check this user ID and password from the notification email described in ”**Preparation**” step or the screen of application completed.
* If there are any setting items other than mentioned above, please configure them as needed. If you have no particular inclination, you can leave the default settings.
* During the connecting operation, a screen may appear asking if you trust the certificate. To verify whether the certificate is correct, compare the "server fingerprint" of the displayed certificate with the fingerprint listed in 「[Connect Configuration](/utokyo_wifi/#connect-configuration)」. If they match, trust the certificate.
    * Additionally, there are two kinds of fingerprints (SHA-1 and SHA-256) listed on 「[Connect Configuration](/utokyo_wifi/#connect-configuration)」, either match is fine.
