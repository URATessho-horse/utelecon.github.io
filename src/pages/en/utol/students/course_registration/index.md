In UTOL, courses offered per term or semester are called “courses”.

Once you “register for a course”, it will appear on the timetable, and you can view the course materials.

## Caution
{:#precautions}

There are four types of course registrations, and the timetable displays which type of registration has been made.

For your convenience, the course registrations types will be divided into the following two categories.

1. Registration by course instructors or through UTAS:
    * “Enrolled registration”: Automatically registers the courses you have taken.
    * “Favorite registration”: Is a registration made through the UTAS (the Educational System). This registration will be deleted after the enrollment period.
    * “Registered by instructor”: Is a registration that the course instructor made manually.

2. Temporary self-registration by the students:
    * This is a “self-registration” that can be made by clicking the button “Register a course” on UTOL. (This registration may be deleted after the enrollment registration period.)

After the enrollment registration period ends, the “favorite registrations” will be deleted.  In addition, depending on the course settings, “self-registrations” may be deleted, and you may not be able to register for a new course. In this case, to register for a course, please ask your course instructor to change the course settings.

**Even if you proceed with the “course registration” in UTOL, you will not be enrolled in the course. Therefore, if you need to enroll in a course, be sure to use UTAS (the Educational System) for enrollment registration.**

## Procedures for registering for a course

The registration procedure for a course varies depending on the [course registration status](#precautions) shown in the timetable.

### When registered through UTAS or by the course instructors

Registrations through UTAS or by the course instructors can be made by following the steps below.

* “Enrolled registration”: You will be automatically registered you for the courses you are currently taking. If enrollment registration for a course on UTAS is made, the registration on UTOL will be completed the following morning.
* “Favorite registration”: If you register for a favorite-listed course on UTAS, you will be enrolled in the course on UTOL the following morning. This registration will be deleted when the enrollment is confirmed.
* “Registered by instructor”: For courses that students are not currently taking, they can request the instructor to register them for the courses manually.

### When students make temporary self-registrations
{:#self-registration}

If a course instructor has set up a course so that students can “audit” it, students can register for the course by themselves (”self-registration”) and view the course contents. To register for a course that allows “self-registration”, follow the steps below.

1. To find the course you wish to enroll in, use the [Search Course function](../course_search/). If you check the “Only courses that can be registered” box, only courses that allow “self-registration” will be displayed.
